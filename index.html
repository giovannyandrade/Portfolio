        <h3 id="aboutme">I am Giovanny Andrade</h3>
        <p>Currently a student at Long Beach City College, I am a first year computer science student where so far I have taken classes as Introduction to computer science and Data Structures and Algorithms, I know I have a lot to learn but little by little I will get where I want.Some things about myself is that I really like soccer and food, especially tacos and lasagna haha:), in my free time I like to read and make small programs trying to improve my syntax in  C++; My goal is to keep improving in my coding skills and transfer to get my bachelor's degree.</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMe at Metropolitan Park of Leon, Guanajuato, Mexico:&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is My favorite Place in Guadalajara:&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMe and friends at the Chivas Stadium:</p>

        <h4>I've done small projects in my CS intro and data structure and algorithm classes, all of them very shorts.</h4>
        <p>In my first project I had to do a program where "a bank" wanted a program that is able to read data from files and the calculate and display the final balance of money invested in a savings account. </p>
        <link><a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XK82NcYZhO7Kv5JW1nVPUnNtEAeJ3_0l/view?usp=sharing">First Project</a></link>
        <p>My Second project involved the use of 2D arrays to display data about the production of apples and oranges in certain countries around the world.</p>
        <link><a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sv5CSGL6avPHFMx_7wmHdyrWSklp6CN-?usp=sharing">Second Project</a></link>
        <p>My Third and most recent project was to read and  sort data by population in a "Census File" where originally the file was sorted alphabetically by state.</p>
